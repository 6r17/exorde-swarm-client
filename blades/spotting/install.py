# Install

This script is used within dockerfile to prepare images with various models.

# Bare
I do not recommend doing so as the different models are large and will probably
polute your userspace. Keeping them as docker images will guarantee a method of
cleaning them.

If for some reason you still want to install the client as bare, you can use the 
different Dockerfiles as reference for each different pieces (scraper, spot) and
this folder contains all the scripts referenced in thoses.
